1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Purpose
    ABA is suppose to be a way for people to connect and chat with each other via web page. 
    It will be very simple, it will inlcude login page and upon login, it will take you to 
    a chat site where poeple logged in can message. The page itself will be simple, with
    a box that displays message, another box to type in message, and a send button.
1.2 Document Conventions
    N/A
1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
    ABA will be designed for everyone to chat (again it will be very simple and there will be 
    two users for show). If this were to get more worked on in the future, with a lot more time
    included could be genres of topics that people would be able to go into and talk about that 
    specific topic (however that is not what I will be doing, that would require more time 
    assuming the basic of the project is done).
1.4 Product Scope
    I will be using Odin's public_html directory for this project. The main language I will be 
    using is php, html, CSS, and maybe Bootstrap to make it look really nice. The main goal is 
    to be bale to display the messages and have the send button register.
1.5 References 
    I have done a much more simple page that displayed messages before but not in real time or in 
    a web page, however i have doen it in C. For a reference I will be using
